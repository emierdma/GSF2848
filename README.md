# GSF2848
RNA-seq analysis including alignment, DESeq, SAILOR, and SAILOR annotation.

Start with "getting set up" to create rnaseq conda environment and copy files from the project space to your slate directory.

Continue to "code for alignment" to align reads to a reference genome using STAR.

Once alignment is complete, proceed to "DESeq on R studio" for differential expression analysis, or to "SAILOR" followed by "SAILOR annotation" for editing site identification.
